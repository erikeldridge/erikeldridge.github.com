A large black walnut tree lives in my yard.

I would like to find California native companion plants for it, but have had a difficult time.

Something about the soil made me think it was poor. It was clay to begin with, but also full of gravel, construction debris and covered by barrier plastic and rocks in many places. Few things grow well.

The walnut and neighboring buildings cast the yard in shade. California is frequently in drought, so it's dry. I've recently learned walnuts are [allelopathic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allelopathy).

[The Black Walnut Dispatch](https://blackwalnutdispatch.com/the-black-walnut-society/) inspires me to take and share notes so we might all learn together.

The permaculture discipline has also been helpful, not least because it has many handy phrases like _guild_ (recreations of plant communities found in nature) and _companion plants_ (symbiotic or mutually supportive), and concepts like a [_seven-layer garden_](https://www.chelseagreen.com/blogs/designing-a-forest-garden-the-seven-story-garden/) and soil building.

I've found [Gaia's Garden by Toby Hemenway](https://www.chelseagreen.com/gaias-garden-second-edition) to be a concise introduction to permaculture, and it even has an in-depth description of a walnut guild!

Paul Stamets, a hero, is also a fan of permaculture and proposes a [Stametsian Model](http://www.fungi.com/blog/items/permaculture-with-a-mycological-twist.html) with an eighth layer for fungi.

So, the challenge is: build a juglone-, drought- and shade-tolerant California native guild around the walnut.

Here are the plants I've tried, organized by what's taken and what hasn't.
