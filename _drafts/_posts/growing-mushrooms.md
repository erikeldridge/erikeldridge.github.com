I want to grow mushrooms in my garden.

More specifically, I want to experiment with a theory described by Paul Stamets in [Report from the Underground](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAw_Zzge49c) that some fungi assist bee immunology. Stamets formulated the hypothesis after noticing bees visiting a King Stropharia (Stropharia rugosoannulata) patch in his garden.

A beekeeper maintains hives in my yard and among other things treats bees suffering from mites. Despite his efforts, one of the three colonies has collapsed. Stamets talks about a product (MycoHoney) he's developing to directly support bees, but until that becomes available, I'd like to see if growing S. rugosoannulata near the hives helps.

Step 1: get mushrooms. Stamets' company Fungi Perfecti makes this easy by selling [outdoor kits for King Stropharia](http://www.fungi.com/product-detail/product/the-garden-giant-mushroom-patch.html).

Step 2: get wood chips. The kit documentation states S. rugosoannulata grows on wood chips or straw. Since Stamets' hypothesis concerns bees visiting rotting wood, I'd like to try wood chips, but where does one get fresh wood chips?
