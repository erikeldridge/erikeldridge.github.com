I wanted to grow mushrooms in my garden for a few reasons: to improve bee and soil health and provide food.

Regarding bee health, I wanted to experiment with a theory described by Paul Stamets in [Report from the Underground](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAw_Zzge49c) that some fungi assist bee immunology. Stamets formulated the hypothesis after noticing bees visiting a King Stropharia ([Stropharia rugosoannulata](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/119151-Stropharia-rugosoannulata)) patch in his garden.

A beekeeper maintained hives in my yard and among other things treated bees suffering from mites. Despite his efforts, one of the three colonies had collapsed. Stamets' talk mentioned a product (MycoHoney) he's developing to directly support bees, but until that becomes available, I wanted to see if growing S. rugosoannulata near the hives helped.

Step 1: get mushrooms. Stamets' company Fungi Perfecti made this easy by selling [outdoor kits for King Stropharia](http://www.fungi.com/product-detail/product/the-garden-giant-mushroom-patch.html).

Step 2: get wood chips. Kit documentation stated S. rugosoannulata grows on wood chips or straw. I was inclined toward the former because Stamets' hypothesis concerned bees visiting rotting wood, but where does one get wood chips clean enough to use for food-grade mushrooms?

Fungi Perfecti mentioned alder chips are ideal, but most non-aromatic hardwoods will do. Additional research indicated the chips should be more than a few weeks old, so the trees' natural anti-fungal properties have broken down, but not so old that other fungi have colonized.

Tree trimming companies are eager to give away fresh chips (to avoid disposal fees), but require recipients to accept a full truck load of several cubic yards, which more than I need, and have space for a large truck to make the delivery, which I don't.

Some waste disposal companies allow individuals to visit and haul away wood chips for free, but I'd like a bit more assurance the wood is from non-aromatic hardwoods, fresh and clean.
