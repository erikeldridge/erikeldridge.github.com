I use the term "compute" (or "exec") to refer to a remote environment in which I can execute a process.

In terms of a toolkit, this is a fundamental component, ie I can create a service, but it needs to run somewhere public to be useful.

EC2 and Google Cloud both provide a great service.

For VMs, I prefer Ubuntu 16.04, mostly just because it has an organization (Canonical) behind it.
