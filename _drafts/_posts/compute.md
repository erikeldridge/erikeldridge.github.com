I use the term "compute" to refer to a remote environment in which I can run execute a process.

EC2 is the most generally useful in my experience, perhaps because I use Cloud9 for an editor with my netbook.

That said, I like [Google's Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell/ "Google Cloud Shell") and how both Google and Azure have a relatively simple process for updating the public keys used for accessing an instance.

For VMs, I prefer Ubuntu 16.04, mostly just because it has an organization (Canonical) behind it.
