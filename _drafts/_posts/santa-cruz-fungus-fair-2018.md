I attended the [Fungus Federation of Santa Cruz 2018 Fungus Fair](http://ffsc.us/fair) for the first time last weekend. I highly recommend it and plan to go again.

The fair had a large room with several hundred labeled specimens from the Santa Cruz area, grouped by genus and/or tree they're associated with. I was impressed by the diversity of mushrooms found on a given couple days (all were fresh, and several had started disintegrating) in a given region.

The specimen room also had an identification table staffed by several experts who could identify mushrooms brought in on the day of the fair. The authors of Mushrooms of the Redwood Coast were there, for example.

The fair also had two tracks of speakers, main and "Mushrooms 101". I spent the day attending talks in the latter.

The first talk was "Common Edible and Poisonous Mushrooms of California" presented by Noah Siegel, co-author of _Mushrooms of the Redwood Coast_. A couple notes:

* In terms of perspective, California has more than 3000 mushrooms (defined as the classic cap and stalk we'd hunt, aka _terrestrial_) of which 30 or so are edible
* Nothing looks like a black trumpet, so we might consider a foolproof five. (Professor Clyde Christensen dubbed the Morel, Shaggy Mane, Puffball and Sulfur Shelf as a "foolproof four" that are easy for beginners to identify.)
