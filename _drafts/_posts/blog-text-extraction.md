## Problem

I want to build a "design vocabulary", to borrow Peter Korn's phrase from [_Why We Make Things and Why It Matters_](why-we-make-things-and-why-it-matters-by-peter-korn).

For each idea I reference repeatedly in this blog, I'd like:
1. a post describing idea
1. a tag I can apply to posts referencing the idea
1. a light visual indicator for each occurance in text

Readers, including me, should be able to filter blog content by tag/idea to see all references and find the description. Readers should also be able to scan content visually and see repeated ideas, but without the clutter of bolding or linking every occurance.

Managing this manually is tedious and error prone. I'd appreciate help from automation.

## Context

I'm new to NLP, so this post will include some basics.

I'd like to get more experience with data science, and in a way that's congruent with CSUMB's data science concentration, and reinforce my Python experience per my academic advisory, so I'll bias toward Python tooling. I can imagine finding a functional overlap with Jekyll plugins, so I may revisit this decision.
