Here's a quick list of movies I've enjoyed.

My wife and I enjoy re-watching _Bridget Jones' Diary_, _Trading Places_, _Moonstruck_ and _Babette's Feast_ around Christmas time 🍄🎄.

_The Edge of Tomorrow_.

David Fincher's _The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo_.

_Kung Fu Hustle_ and _Shaolin Soccer_ for mystical humor.

_The Little Hours_.

Guy Ritchie's _Sherlock Holmes_.

_This is the End_.

_Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy_.

I think often of _Solaris_, directed by Andrei Tarkovsky in 1972.
