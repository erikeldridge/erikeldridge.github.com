# Management

* toc
{:toc}


## Asynchronous communication

Use group IM (Campfire, HipChat, etc) where possible.

Use task tracking tool, e.g., Jira, for project state management.

Use wiki for documentation. Actively prune. Invest in tools to indicate content freshness.


## Task tracking

Task tracking is powerful and costly.

Invest in usable UI and automation, e.g., git hooks, to reduce cost.

Use one tool across the company, at all layers, and define one set of best-practices, to maximize value.


## Meetings

Meetings are powerful and costly.

Include an agenda in the invite.

Focus on the goals during the meeting to maximize value.

Avoid unplanned drop-ins. Randomization is toxic.


## Team size

Build teams only to the size where the manager can still have weekly 1:1s.


## Quiet

Establish weekly no-meeting days, and quarterly no-meeting weeks.

Prefer non-verbal comms, e.g., use dashboard rather than request status updates


## Hiring

Run batch interview days to minimize context switching for interviewers, and increase relative grading ability.


## Deadlines

Create routine deadlines before a break, e.g., Friday, not Monday, to disincentivize working through the break.


## Cross-team collaboration

Consolidate around a periodic stakeholders sync mtng, e.g., a Friday project review to track progress

Use a common task tracking tool to coordinate, i.e., avoid separate teams having separate tracking tools.

Focus on aligning goals and sharing costs. See notes on [managing external contributions](/notes/managing-external-contributions.html).


## 360° review

Define a 360° review process. Review twice per year. Use tech ladder as scafolding for feedback.
