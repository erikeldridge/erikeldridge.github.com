# Management


## Asynchronous communication

Use group IM (Campfire, HipChat, etc) where possible.

Use task tracking tool for project state management. Invest in usable UI and automation, e.g., git hooks.

Use wiki for documentation. Actively prune. Invest in tools to indicate content freshness.


## Quiet

Establish weekly no-meeting days, and quarterly no-meeting weeks.

Place high cost on personal interaction. Prefer async comms.


## Hiring

Run batch interview days to minimize context switching for interviewers, and increase relative grading ability.
