I was first introduced to the concept of "regional trails" (maintained trails an urban or suburban context) by the [Iron Horse trail](http://www.ebparks.org/parks/trails/iron_horse) running through Walnut Creek, which I walked along frequently and with gusto!

That trail is part of the larger [Interpark trail network](http://www.ebparks.org/parks/trails) connecting cities in the area, and introduced me to the [Rails-to-Trails](https://www.railstotrails.org) project.

Rails-to-trails points at [TrailLink](https://www.traillink.com), which I could use to search for other trails. This led me to the [West County regional trail](http://parks.sonomacounty.ca.gov/Get_Outdoors/Parks/West_County_Regional_Trail.aspx) when I was looking for a place to bike in Sebastopol.

The [San Francisco Bay Trail](http://baytrail.org/) is an ambitious effort to connect 500 miles of trails around the San Francisco Bay Area. Many of my colleagues bike along it to work, and I'm lucky enough to walk along it on my way home from work.

The [Santa Rosa creek trail](https://www.traillink.com/trail/santa-rosa-creek-trail/) is a beautiful path along a creek through a green belt in downtown Santa Rosa, and is also part of a larger trail network.

In case any civic planners, or folks voting on regional trail issues, are reading this, I'm a big fan of the concept and grateful for the existing trails üëç
