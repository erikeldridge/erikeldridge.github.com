Here are a few things that seem to make teamwork flow smoothly.

## Get help

When working on a new problem, to avoid overlooking a solution that would be obvious to someone with more experience, it's beneficial to balance concentration with consultation.

Before complaining about a new code base, make sure to perform due diligence to avoid sounding like a newb. We're all smart and have the best intentions, if something is difficult to work with, it's probably that way for a reason.

If possible, publish an early version of a project and solicit feedback. Staging servers work well for this. Stage the project once it's somewhat functional and send around an email. Other teams might have unexpected solutions.

## Over-communicate

This ties into the idea of consultation. When working with a team, it's helpful to regularly sync with the other members so they know how to use the piece I'm building, the status of my progress, and that we're all pulling weight.
