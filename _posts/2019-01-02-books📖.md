Here's a quick list of books I've enjoyed, in alpha order.

Note: I bias toward the humorous, humane and irreverent; mystical and military.

_Afterparty_ by Daryl Gregory.

_Ancillary Justice_ by Ann Leckie.

_Autobiography of Yogi_ by Paramahansa Yogananda. Caveat: this book was written for a Christian audience in the 1950s; _Fourth Uncle in the Mountain_ provided helpful normalization.

_Fourth Uncle in the Mountain_, by Marjorie Pivar and Quang Van Nguyen.

All three _Germline_ books by T.C. McCarthy.

_How to Change Your Mind_ by Michael Pollan.

Tulsidas' _Ramayana_.

_Tibet's Great Yogi Milarepa_ by W.Y. Evans-Wentz.
