A large black walnut tree lives in the back yard.

I would like to find California native companion plants for it, but have had a difficult time.

Something about the soil made me think it's poor. It was clay to begin with, but also full of gravel, construction debris and covered by barrier plastic and pea gravel, pavers and bricks in many places. Few things grow well.

The walnut and neighboring buildings cast the yard in shade. California is frequently in drought, so it's dry. I've recently learned walnuts are [allelopathic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allelopathy).

[The Black Walnut Dispatch](https://blackwalnutdispatch.com/the-black-walnut-society/) inspires me to take and share notes so we might all learn together.

The permaculture discipline has also been helpful, not least because it has many handy phrases like _guild_ (recreations of plant communities found in nature) and _companion plants_ (symbiotic or mutually supportive), and concepts like a [_seven-layer garden_](https://www.chelseagreen.com/blogs/designing-a-forest-garden-the-seven-story-garden/) and soil building.

I've found [Gaia's Garden by Toby Hemenway](https://www.chelseagreen.com/gaias-garden-second-edition) to be a concise introduction to permaculture, and it even has an in-depth description of a walnut guild!

Paul Stamets, a hero, is also a fan of permaculture and proposes a [Stametsian Model](http://www.fungi.com/blog/items/permaculture-with-a-mycological-twist.html) with an eighth layer for fungi.

So, the challenge is: build a juglone-, drought- and shade-tolerant California native guild around the walnut.

Here are the plants I've tried:

| Latin name | Common name | Layer | Health (5 = Thriving) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Achillea millefolium californica](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/239065-Achillea-millefolium-californica) | California yarrow | Herb | 3 | Suspect more sun needed, but one in the front yard in shade is fuller |
| [Allium triquetrum](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/55505-Allium-triquetrum) | Three-cornered leek | Herb | 5 | Self-propagating |
| [Aquilegia eximia](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/57230-Aquilegia-eximia) | Serpentine columbine | Shrub | 1 | The columbine's health steadily declined after planting, dropping leaves and never flowering. |
| [Brugmansia arborea](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/126914-Brugmansia-arborea) | Trumpet flower | Low tree | 4 | Flowering and leaves look good. Suspect more sun needed |
| [Clinopodium douglasii](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/53203-Clinopodium-douglasii) | Yerba buena | Ground | 4 | Leaves look good, but growth is slow |
| [Fragaria californica](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/61095-Fragaria-vesca-californica) | Wild strawberry | Ground | 3 | Spreading and leaves look good, but not flowering. Suspect more sun needed |
| [Heracleum maximum](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/53094-Heracleum-maximum) | Cow parsnip | Shrub | 2 | Under dripline. Planted two and both died back, but one returned. Leaves ok so far |
| [Horkelia californica](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/61737-Horkelia-californica) | California horkelia | Ground | 4 | Hasn't flowered or spread. Suspect more sun needed |
| [Iris douglasiana](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/50854-Iris-douglasiana) | Douglas Iris | Shrub | 4 | Planted two. One died. The other's leaves look good, but it hasn't flowered. There's another iris nearby that's flowering, for comparison |
| [Nandina domestica](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/127010-Nandina-domestica) | Heavenly bamboo | Shrub | 4 | Here when I moved in. |
| [Pittosporum tobira](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/78592-Pittosporum-tobira)| Mock orange | Low tree | 5| Flowering and leaves look good |
| [Oxalis pes-caprae](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/53169-Oxalis-pes-caprae) | Sourgrass | Herb | 5 | It's invasive, but in the spirit of permaculture I'm trying to learn from it. Makes me want to try a [native oxalis](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/78298-Oxalis-californica) |
