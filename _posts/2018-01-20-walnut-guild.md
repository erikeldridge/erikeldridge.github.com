A large black walnut tree lives in the back yard.

I would like to find California native companion plants for it, but have had a difficult time.

Something about the soil makes me think it's poor. It's clay to begin with, but also full of gravel, construction debris and covered by barrier plastic and pea gravel, pavers and bricks in many places. Few things grow well.

The walnut and neighboring buildings cast the yard in shade. California is frequently in drought, so it's dry. I've recently learned walnuts are [allelopathic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allelopathy).

[The Black Walnut Dispatch](https://blackwalnutdispatch.com/the-black-walnut-society/) inspires me to take and share notes so we might all learn together.

The permaculture discipline has also been helpful, not least because it has many handy phrases like [_guild_](https://www.chelseagreen.com/blogs/natural-polycultures-mimicking-nature-in-your-veggie-garden/) (recreations of plant communities found in nature) and [_companion plants_](https://www.chelseagreen.com/blogs/interplanting-and-beyond/) (symbiotic or mutually supportive), and concepts like a [_seven-layer garden_](https://www.chelseagreen.com/blogs/designing-a-forest-garden-the-seven-story-garden/) and soil building.

I've found [Gaia's Garden by Toby Hemenway](https://www.chelseagreen.com/gaias-garden-second-edition) a concise introduction to permaculture, and it even has an in-depth description of a walnut guild!

Paul Stamets, a hero, is a fan of permaculture and proposes a [Stametsian Model](http://www.fungi.com/blog/items/permaculture-with-a-mycological-twist.html) with an eighth layer for fungi.

Las Pilitas Nursary is a rich source of [native plant](http://www.laspilitas.com/nature-of-california/native-plants-san-jose.html) and [permaculture](http://www.laspilitas.com/garden/howto/permaculture/permaculture1.htm) information.

So, the challenge is: build a juglone-, drought- and shade-tolerant California native guild around the walnut.

Here are the plants I've tried:

| Latin name | Common name | Layer | Health\* | Proximity\* | Sun\* | Water\* | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Achillea millefolium californica](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/239065-Achillea-millefolium-californica) | California yarrow | Herb | 3 | 1 | 4 | 1 | Suspect more sun needed, but one in the front yard in shade is fuller |
| [Allium triquetrum](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/55505-Allium-triquetrum) | Three-cornered leek | Herb | 5 | 1 | 2-4 | 1 | Self-propagating |
| [Aquilegia eximia](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/57230-Aquilegia-eximia) | Serpentine columbine | Shrub | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | The columbine's health steadily declined after planting, dropping leaves and never flowering. |
| [Asarum caudatum](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/52858-Asarum-caudatum) | Western wild ginger | Root | 4 | 3 | 2 | 2 | Leaves look good, but growth is slow and it hasn't flowered. I suspect it needs more water |
| [Brugmansia arborea](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/126914-Brugmansia-arborea) | Trumpet flower | Low tree | 4 | 2 | 4 | 1 | Flowering and leaves look good. Suspect more sun needed |
| [Callistemon rigidus](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/146916-Callistemon-rigidus) | Bottlebrush tree | Low tree | 5 | 3 | 4 | 1 | Flowers profusely year-round |
| Citrus tangerina | Tangerine tree | Low tree | 2 | 1 | 3 | 1 | The tree produces inedible fruit and its leaves are chlorotic and sparse :( I suspect it gets insufficient sun. There's a lemon tree in the front yard that looks great, for comparison |
| [Camellia japonica](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/83056-Camellia-japonica) | Camelia | Low tree | 1 & 5 | 3 | 2-3 | 2 | Two camellias on the property outside dripline. One in good health, but one suddenly whithered. Suspecting gophers although they left the other alone. |
| [Claytonia sibirica](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/55767-Claytonia-sibirica) | Candy flower | Herb | 5 | 3 | 2 | 2 | Leaves and growth look good |
| [Clinopodium douglasii](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/53203-Clinopodium-douglasii) | Yerba buena | Ground | 4 | 1 | 2 | 2 | Leaves look good, but growth is slow |
| [Festuca californica](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/57169-Festuca-californica)  | California fescue | Ground |  | 1 | 2 | 1 | New planting🤞 |
| [Fragaria californica](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/61095-Fragaria-vesca-californica) | Wild strawberry | Ground | 3 | 1 | 3 | 1 | Spreading and leaves look good, but not flowering. Suspect more sun needed |
| [Hedera helix](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/55882-Hedera-helix) | English ivy | Vine | 5 | 2 | 3 | 1 | Well-established when I moved in. Grows vigorously on wall at dripline. Less vigorously inside dripline |
| Heracleum maximum | Cow parsnip | Shrub | 2 | 1 | 2 | 2 | Under dripline. Planted two and both died back, but one returned. Leaves ok so far |
| Holodiscus discolor | Cream bush | Shrub | 4 | 1 | 2 | 2 | Leaves look good, but slow growing |
| Horkelia californica | California horkelia | Ground | 4 | 1 | 3 | 1 | Hasn't flowered or spread. Suspect more sun needed |
| Hydrangea macrophylla | Hydrangea | Shrub | 1 | 3 | 3 | 1 | A tall shrub growing in shade when I moved in. Declining health perhaps due to low water or sun |
| Iris douglasiana | Douglas Iris | Shrub | 4 | 1 | 3 | 1 | Planted two. One died. The other's leaves look good, but it hasn't flowered. There's another iris nearby that's flowering, for comparison |
| Lupinus arboreus | Yellow bush lupine | Shrub |  | 1 | 4 | 1 | New planting in a relatively sunny spot🤞 I read somewhere nitrogen fixers are generally juglone-tolerant |
| Lupinus variicolor | Varied lupine | Shrub |  | 1 | 4 | 1 | As above |
| Mimulus aurantiacus | Bush monkeyflower | Shrub | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | Planted in shade. Leaves and growth look good, but waiting for flowers |
| Mimulus aurantiacus | Bush monkeyflower var ? | Shrub | 4 | 1 | 3 | 1 | A lower, spreading mimulus planted in shade. Leaves and growth look good, but waiting for flowers |
| Nandina domestica | Heavenly bamboo | Shrub | 4 | 2 | 3-4 | 1 | Leaves look healthy. |
| Oxalis pes-caprae | Sourgrass | Herb | 5 | 1 | 2-4 | 1-2 | Under dripline. It's invasive, but in the spirit of permaculture I'm trying to learn from it. Makes me want to try a native oxalis |
| Pittosporum tobira | Mock orange | Low tree | 5 | 3 | 5 | 1 | Flowering and leaves look good |
| Prunus cerasifera | Purple leaf ornamental plum | Low tree | 3 | 1 | 3 | 1 | I think this is a plum. The tree leaves regularly, but hasn't flowered and has dying branches. I suspect it was planted when the walnut was smaller and let more light through |
| Plantago subnuda | Tall coastal plantain | Herb |   | 1 | 2 | 2 | New planting🤞 |
| Rudbeckia californica | California coneflower | Shrub | 5 | 1 | 4 | 1 | Planted in a pot (away from slugs) but in range of leaf fall |
| Stachys bullata | Wood mint | Herb |  | 1 | 2 | 2 | New planting🤞 |
| Symphyotrichum chilense | California aster | Shrub | 4 | 3 | 3 | 1 | Leaves look good, slow growing |
| Taraxacum officinale | Dandelion | Herb | 4 | 1 | 3 | 1 | Self-propagating. Leaves look good. If it flowers and spreads, I'll increase the health grade to 5 |

\* Numeric ranges:

* Health: 1-5, 5 = thriving
* Proximity: 1-3, 1 = planted inside dripline of walnut
* Sun: 1-5, 5 = planted in full sun
* Water: 1-3, 3 = planted in wet soil
