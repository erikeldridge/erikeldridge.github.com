The [Bay Area Mushroom Society](http://www.bayareamushrooms.org/) organized a foray on December 9 to collect specimens for the [Point Reyes National Seashore Fungus Fair](https://www.nps.gov/pore/planyourvisit/events_fungusfair.htm). Around 50 people participated, splitting into groups to search Point Reyes and neighboring parks.

My wife (who observed "trees were full of life, even after death") and I chose to look along the Mt Wittenberg trail, teaming up briefly with a forager and his sons (one in a Baby Bjorn) from Petaluma, and later with a grad student from Berkeley (who was momentarily "captivated by another kingdom" while admiring a large Bay tree).

The trail passed a pines, under which we found Suillus [granulatus](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/179065-Suillus-granulatus)(?),  [Xerocomellus chrysenteron](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/438013-Xerocomellus-chrysenteron) (Cracking Red Bolete), [Russula xerampelina](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/154875-Russula-xerampelina) (Shrimp Russula), and lots of [Laccaria amethysteo-occidentalis](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/54893-Laccaria-amethysteo-occidentalis), and through Bay forrest in which we found [Gymnopilus ventricosus](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/348809-Gymnopilus-ventricosus) (Jumbo Gym), [Armillaria mellea](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/55950-Armillaria-mellea) (Honey Mushroom) and â€Ž[Hypholoma fasciculare](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/48767-Hypholoma-fasciculare) (Sulphur Tuft). Foragers gathered at the Red Barn classroom to compare and identify. A couple people found [Bolete edulis](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/48701-Boletus-edulis) (King Bolete) with bagel-shaped caps. 

This trip was joyful for a number of reasons: the kids _loved_ mushroom hunting; I finally glimpsed [Amanita Muscaria](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/48715-Amanita-muscaria) ("Super Mario mushroom" to one fellow hiker), which appeared like Santa under a Christmas tree (next to the parking lot!), and [Amanita phalloides](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/52135-Amanita-phalloides) (Death Cap), striking with its cup, veil and metallic yellow-green tint, which I've long feared, but never seen; interactions with many smart, friendly people; hours of immersion in nature, off-trail, intently searching for treasure in the leaves.

I highly recommend attending a foray. See you there!
