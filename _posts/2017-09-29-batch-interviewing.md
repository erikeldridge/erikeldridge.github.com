## Solution

Schedule interviews in blocks, eg 5 back-to-back interviews in a day.

Perform a quick evaluation after each interview, eg 45 minutes of interview, 10 minutes of eval, 5 minutes to transition.

Huddle at the end of the day, ask each interviewer to vote, stack rank candidates, and make hiring decisions.

Batch interviewing, aka on-campus interviewing, is common at some schools, notably [Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/get-hired/interview-process/interview-cycles), which in my experience consistently produces high-performing candidates. (Students also gain an uncommon amount of practical experience through their co-op program.)

Enable students to efficiently gain experience, and administrators and recruiters to efficiently schedule, by adding interview blocks to a standard process. 

## Problem

Focus work is fundamentally different than interpersonal work and requires blocks of uninterrupted time. [Graham] and [Davies] mention ~4 hr blocks, which is consistent with my experience. For this reason, scheduling interviews at arbitrary times is extra costly for developers.

Because interviewing requires standard problems, it differs from day to day work, so we need to warm up in advance.

Scheduling several people at arbitary times is also costly for recruiters (unless interviews have top priority, in which case this cost is pushed onto the interviewer.

Motivating everyone on an interview panel to submit feedback quickly is hard, which delays hiring decisions.

Traditional hiring pipelines are at risk of institutional bias, which decreases efficiency when sourcing candidates from diverse backgrounds.

Accumulating experience interviewing, a key factor for success, is hard when each company has a different process.
