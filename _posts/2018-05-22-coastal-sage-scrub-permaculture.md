# Problem statement

I live in the [coastal sage scrub plant community](https://www.laspilitas.com/nature-of-california/communities/coastal-sage-scrub). I'd like the plants growing around my home to reflect this community and/or produce food.

The permaculture discipline provides handy phrases like [_guild_](https://www.chelseagreen.com/blogs/natural-polycultures-mimicking-nature-in-your-veggie-garden/) (recreations of plant communities found in nature) and [_companion plants_](https://www.chelseagreen.com/blogs/interplanting-and-beyond/) (symbiotic or mutually supportive), and concepts like a [_seven-layer garden_](https://www.chelseagreen.com/blogs/designing-a-forest-garden-the-seven-story-garden/) and soil building.

I've found [Gaia's Garden by Toby Hemenway](https://www.chelseagreen.com/gaias-garden-second-edition) a concise introduction.

Paul Stamets, a hero, is a fan of permaculture and proposes a [Stametsian Model](http://www.fungi.com/blog/items/permaculture-with-a-mycological-twist.html) with an eighth layer for fungi.

Las Pilitas Nursary is a rich source of [native plant](http://www.laspilitas.com/nature-of-california/communities/coastal-sage-scrub) and [permaculture](http://www.laspilitas.com/garden/howto/permaculture/permaculture1.htm) information. CNPS also enables us to [search shade plants by zipcode](http://calscape.org/loc-94010/cat-Part_shade/ord-popular/vw-list/np-1?&poploc=1&srchcr=sc5a6597ead1f9b). [Oaktown nursery](http://oaktownnativenursery.info/ "Oaktown nursery") is one of my favorite sources of native plants.

So, the challenge is: build a California coastal sage scrub guild.

# Solution

Here are the plants I've tried:

| Latin name | Common name | Layer | Health\* | Sun\* | Water\* | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Achillea millefolium californica | California yarrow | Herb | 4 | 2 & 5 | 1 | Suspect more sun needed, but one in the front yard in shade is fuller. |
| Allium triquetrum | Three-cornered leek | Herb | 5 | 1 | 1 | Self-propagating. Curious to try a native Allium like Allium unifolium |
| Agapanthus praecox orientalis | Lilly of the Nile | Shrub | 5 | 1 | 1 | Prolific in the front yard in shade |
| Aquilegia eximia | Serpentine columbine | Shrub | 4 | 3 | 2 | The columbine's health steadily declined after planting, dropping leaves and never flowering. Transplanted to pot with potting soil and more sun and care and it rebounded. Recently transplanted back. |
| Armeria maritima | Sea thrift | 🤞 | 4 | 2 | Planted Spring 18 |  |
| Artemisia douglasiana | California Mugwort | Herb | 4 | 2 | 1 | Died back completely in summer, but resprouted and grew vigorously after Spring rain |
| Asarum caudatum | Western wild ginger | Root | 3 | 1 | 2 | Leaves look good, but growth is slow and it hasn't flowered. I suspect it needs more water |
| Brugmansia arborea | Trumpet flower | Low tree | 4 | 2 | 1 | Flowering and leaves look good. Suspect more sun needed |
| Callistemon rigidus | Bottlebrush tree | Low tree | 5 | 3 | 1 | Flowers profusely year-round |
| Citrus tangerina | Tangerine tree | Low tree | 2 | 3 | 1 | The tree produces inedible fruit and its leaves are chlorotic and sparse :( I suspect it used to get insufficient sun. An arborist mentioned citrus trees are "hungry", so this one may just need fertilizer. There's a lemon tree in the front yard that looks great, for comparison |
| Camellia japonica | Camelia | Low tree | 5 | 2 | 1 | Two camellias on the property outside dripline. One in good health, but one suddenly whithered. Suspecting gophers although they left the other alone. |
| Claytonia sibirica | Candy flower | Herb | 5 | 1 | 2 | Leaves and growth look great. Flowering. Neighboring ginger |
| Satureja douglasii | Yerba buena | Ground | 4 | 2-3 | 1 | Leaves look good, but growth is slow. Spring rain didn't improve. |
| Dicentra formosa | Bleeding heart | Shrub | 5 | 2-3 | 2 | Planted three. Died back completely after summer, but resprouted and spread vigorously after Spring rain |
| Dietes iridioides | African iris | Shrub | 5 | 1 | 1 | Flowers and seeds readily. |
| Eschscholzia californica | California poppy | Shrub | 4 | 5 | 1 | Gopher favorite, but some survived to bloom this year! |
| Festuca californica | California fescue | Ground | 🤞 | 5 | 1 | Flattened by tree-fall. |
| Fragaria californica | Wild strawberry | Ground | 3 | 3 | 1 | Spreading and leaves look good, but not flowering. |
| Hedera helix | English ivy | Vine | 5 | 4 | 1 | Well-established when I moved in. |
| Helianthus californicus | Shrub | 🤞 | 4 | 1 | Planted Spring 18. Munched by someone, but hanging on |  |
| Heracleum maximum | Cow parsnip | Shrub | 4 | 1 | 2 | Planted two. Both died back, but returned with Spring rain. Leaves good so far |
| Holodiscus discolor | Cream bush | Shrub | 4 | 2 | 1 | Leaves look good, but slow growing |
| Horkelia californica | California horkelia | Ground | 4 | 3 | 1 | Hasn't flowered or spread, but doubled in size after Spring rain |
| Hydrangea macrophylla | Hydrangea | Shrub | 1 | 2 | 1 | A tall shrub growing in shade when I moved in. Declining health perhaps due to low water or sun |
| Iris douglasiana | Douglas Iris | Shrub | 4 | 2 | 1 | Planted two. One died. The other's leaves look good, but it hasn't flowered. There's another iris nearby that's flowering, for comparison. |
| Ligustrum japonicum | Japanese Privet | Low tree | 5 | 1 | 1 | Predates me. Healthy/invasive. |
| Lonicera hispidula | California honeysuckle | Vine | 🤞 | 4 | 1 | Planted Spring 18. Munched a bit, but seems to be growing |
| Lupinus arboreus | Yellow bush lupine | Shrub | 4 | 4 | 1 | Planted in pot in sun. Flowering! |
| Lupinus variicolor | Varied lupine | Shrub |  | 1 | 1 | Planted in shade by compost pile. Demolished by slugs |
| Mimulus aurantiacus | Bush monkeyflower | Shrub | 3 | 1 | 1 | Planted in shade. Leaves and growth look good, but waiting for flowers |
| Mimulus aurantiacus | Bush monkeyflower var ? | Shrub | 5 | 3 | 1 | A lower, spreading mimulus. Leaves and growth look good. Flowering. Doubled in size after Spring rain. |
| Nandina domestica | Heavenly bamboo | Shrub | 5 | 2-5 | 1 | Pre-existing. Invasive |
| Oxalis pes-caprae | Sourgrass | Herb | 5 | 2-4 | 1 | Invasive, but in the spirit of permaculture I'm trying to learn from it. Makes me want to try a native oxalis like Oxalis oregana |
| Papaver heterophyllum | Wind poppy | Shrub | 🤞 | 5 | 1 | Planted Spring 18 |
| Pittosporum eugenioides | Tarata | Low tree | 5 | 3 | 1 | Predates me. Healthy. Looks like a volunteer. |
| Pittosporum tobira | Mock orange | Low tree | 5 | 5 | 1 | Flowering and leaves look good |
| Prunus cerasifera | Purple leaf ornamental plum | Low tree | 3 | 5 | 1 | The tree leaves and flowers regularly, but has dying branches. Arborist advised removal due to ill health. |
| Plantago subnuda | Tall coastal plantain | Herb | 2 | 2 | 1 | Slug favorite. |
| Romneya coulteri | Matilija poppy | Shrub | 4 | 5 | 1 | Transplanted(!) Fall 17 |

| Stachys bullata | Wood mint | Herb | 2 | 3 | 1 | Slow growing. |
| Symphyotrichum chilense | California aster | Shrub | 3 | 2 | 1 | Leaves look good, but slow growing. Suspect more sun needed. |
| Taraxacum officinale | Dandelion | Herb | 5 | 3 | 1 | Self-propagating. Leaves look good. Flowered. |

\* Numeric ranges:

* Health: 1-5, 5 = thriving
* Sun: 1-5, 5 = full sun
* Water: 1-3, 3 = wet soil
