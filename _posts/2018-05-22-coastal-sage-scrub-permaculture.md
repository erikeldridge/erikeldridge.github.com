# Problem statement

I live in the [Burlingame "Terrace"](https://goo.gl/maps/TTiNWPgg1kw), which is in the [coastal sage scrub plant community](https://www.laspilitas.com/nature-of-california/communities/coastal-sage-scrub). I'd like the plants growing around my home to reflect this community and/or produce food.

The permaculture discipline provides handy phrases like [_guild_](https://www.chelseagreen.com/blogs/natural-polycultures-mimicking-nature-in-your-veggie-garden/) (recreations of plant communities found in nature) and [_companion plants_](https://www.chelseagreen.com/blogs/interplanting-and-beyond/) (symbiotic or mutually supportive), and concepts like a [_seven-layer garden_](https://www.chelseagreen.com/blogs/designing-a-forest-garden-the-seven-story-garden/) and soil building.

I've found [Gaia's Garden by Toby Hemenway](https://www.chelseagreen.com/gaias-garden-second-edition) a concise introduction. Paul Stamets, a hero, is a fan of permaculture and proposes a [Stametsian Model](http://www.fungi.com/blog/items/permaculture-with-a-mycological-twist.html) with an eighth layer for fungi.

Las Pilitas Nursary is a rich source of [native plant](http://www.laspilitas.com/nature-of-california/communities/coastal-sage-scrub) and [permaculture](http://www.laspilitas.com/garden/howto/permaculture/permaculture1.htm) information. CNPS also enables us to [search shade plants by zipcode](http://calscape.org/loc-94010/cat-Part_shade/ord-popular/vw-list/np-1?&poploc=1&srchcr=sc5a6597ead1f9b). [Oaktown nursery](http://oaktownnativenursery.info/ "Oaktown nursery") and [Bay Natives](http://www.baynatives.com "Bay Natives nursery") are my favorite sources of native plants.

So, the challenge is: build a California coastal sage scrub guild.

# Solution

Here are the plants I've tried:

| [Achillea millefolium californica](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/239065-Achillea-millefolium-californica) | California yarrow | Herb | 5 | 3 & 5 | 1 | Loves the sun. No water required. Spreading and flowering, but more slowly in part-shade. |
| [Allium triquetrum](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/55505-Allium-triquetrum) | Three-cornered leek | Herb | 5 | 1 | 1 | Pre-existing. Non-native. Self-propagating. Curious to try a native Allium like [Allium unifolium](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/59781-Allium-unifolium) |
| [Agapanthus praecox orientalis](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/57838-Agapanthus-praecox-orientalis) | Lilly of the Nile | Shrub | 5 | 1 | 1 | Pre-existing. Non-native. Prolific in the front yard in shade |
| [Aquilegia eximia](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/57230-Aquilegia-eximia) | Serpentine columbine | Shrub | 4 | 3 | 2 | The columbine's health steadily declined after planting, dropping leaves and never flowering. Transplanted to pot with potting soil and more sun and care and it rebounded. Recently transplanted back. |
| [Arctostaphylos densiflora "Sentinel"](http://www.baynatives.com/plants/Arctostaphylos-densiflora-'Sentinel'/) | Manzanita | Sub-canopy | 🤞 | 4 | 1 | Yerba Buena nursery has [a good description of A. densiflora "Sentinel"](http://www.yerbabuenanursery.com/viewplant.php?pid=149). Planted summer 2018. |
| [Armeria maritima](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/60476-Armeria-maritima) | Sea thrift | Ground |🤞| 4 | 2 | Planted Spring 18. Visibly wilts without regular water. |

| Citrus tangerina | Tangerine tree | Sub-canopy | 2 | 3 | 1 | The tree produces inedible fruit and its leaves are chlorotic and sparse :( I suspect it used to get insufficient sun.

# Observations

Spring 2019

Fat worms, even in unexpected places, like a gravel pile on black plastic under the English ivy.

Salamanders common in moist places, esp under wood.

Bees doing relatively well. Two of three hives survived the winter.

Stropharia mycelium thriving in an area I thought was the sunniest and driest (though it does get a lot of shade) in the back yard. Matalija, Arctostaphylos and Eriogonum growing nearby don't seem to mind.

Flock of robins eating English ivy seeds. Saw goldfinch for the first time. Juncos, towhees, brown creepers, house sparrows, chestnut-backed chickadees, crows common.

Rats and gophers common.

Saw a cat once hunting for rats 🐈
