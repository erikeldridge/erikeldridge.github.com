# Problem statement

I live in the [coastal sage scrub plant community](https://www.laspilitas.com/nature-of-california/communities/coastal-sage-scrub). I'd like the plants growing around my home to reflect this community and/or produce food.

The permaculture discipline provides handy phrases like [_guild_](https://www.chelseagreen.com/blogs/natural-polycultures-mimicking-nature-in-your-veggie-garden/) (recreations of plant communities found in nature) and [_companion plants_](https://www.chelseagreen.com/blogs/interplanting-and-beyond/) (symbiotic or mutually supportive), and concepts like a [_seven-layer garden_](https://www.chelseagreen.com/blogs/designing-a-forest-garden-the-seven-story-garden/) and soil building.

I've found [Gaia's Garden by Toby Hemenway](https://www.chelseagreen.com/gaias-garden-second-edition) a concise introduction.

Paul Stamets, a hero, is a fan of permaculture and proposes a [Stametsian Model](http://www.fungi.com/blog/items/permaculture-with-a-mycological-twist.html) with an eighth layer for fungi.

Las Pilitas Nursary is a rich source of [native plant](http://www.laspilitas.com/nature-of-california/communities/coastal-sage-scrub) and [permaculture](http://www.laspilitas.com/garden/howto/permaculture/permaculture1.htm) information. CNPS also enables us to [search shade plants by zipcode](http://calscape.org/loc-94010/cat-Part_shade/ord-popular/vw-list/np-1?&poploc=1&srchcr=sc5a6597ead1f9b). [Oaktown nursery](http://oaktownnativenursery.info/ "Oaktown nursery") is one of my favorite sources of native plants.

So, the challenge is: build a California coastal sage scrub guild.

# Solution

Here are the plants I've tried:

| Latin name | Common name | Layer | Health\* | Sun\* | Water\* | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Achillea millefolium californica](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/239065-Achillea-millefolium-californica) | California yarrow | Herb | 4 | 2 & 5 | 1 | Suspect more sun needed, but one in the front yard in shade is fuller.|
| [Allium triquetrum](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/55505-Allium-triquetrum) | Three-cornered leek | Herb | 5 | 1 | 1 | Self-propagating. Curious to try a native Allium like [Allium unifolium](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/59781-Allium-unifolium) |
| [Agapanthus praecox orientalis](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/57838-Agapanthus-praecox-orientalis) | Lilly of the Nile | Shrub | 5 | 1 | 1 | Prolific in the front yard in shade |
| [Aquilegia eximia](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/57230-Aquilegia-eximia) | Serpentine columbine | Shrub | 4 | 3 | 2 | The columbine's health steadily declined after planting, dropping leaves and never flowering. Transplanted to pot with potting soil and more sun and care and it rebounded. Recently transplanted back. |
| [Armeria maritima](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/60476-Armeria-maritima) | Sea thrift | Ground |🤞| 4 | 2 | Planted Spring 18 |
| [Artemisia douglasiana](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/52854-Artemisia-douglasiana) | California Mugwort | Herb | 4 | 2 | 1 | Died back completely in summer, but resprouted and grew vigorously after Spring rain |
| [Asarum caudatum](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/52858-Asarum-caudatum) | Western wild ginger | Root | 3 | 1 | 2 | Leaves look good, but growth is slow and it hasn't flowered. I suspect it needs more water |
| [Brugmansia arborea](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/126914-Brugmansia-arborea) | Trumpet flower | Low tree | 4 | 2 | 1 | Flowering and leaves look good. Suspect more sun needed |

| Citrus tangerina | Tangerine tree | Low tree | 2 | 3 | 1 | The tree produces inedible fruit and its leaves are chlorotic and sparse :( I suspect it used to get insufficient sun. An arborist mentioned citrus trees are "hungry", so this one may just need fertilizer. There's a lemon tree in the front yard that looks great, for comparison |
| [Camellia japonica](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/83056-Camellia-japonica) | Camelia | Low tree | 5 | 2 | 1 | Two camellias on the property outside dripline. One in good health, but one suddenly whithered. Suspecting gophers although they left the other alone. |

| [Hydrangea macrophylla](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/122034-Hydrangea-macrophylla) | Hydrangea | Shrub | 1 | 2 | 1 | A tall shrub growing in shade when I moved in. Declining health perhaps due to low water or sun |
| [Iris douglasiana](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/50854-Iris-douglasiana) | Douglas Iris | Shrub | 4 | 2 | 1 | Planted two. One died. The other's leaves look good, but it hasn't flowered. There's another iris nearby that's flowering, for comparison. |
