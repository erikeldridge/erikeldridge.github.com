These are my notes, organized by page, as read through Peter Korn's book *Why We Make Things and Why It Matters*.

53
- "My consciousness comes to inhabit the tip of the knife and the tooth of the saw, so I am not only in the world, but somehow of the world … There is a deep centeredness in trusting one's hands, mind, and imagination to work as a single, well-tuned instrument, a centeredness that touches upon the very essence of fulfillment."
- "learning to do something well for its own sake"
- "‎It is not the hope of achieving game or making money that drives them: rather, it is the opportunity to do the work they enjoy doing." Korn comments this as idealistic, but with an element of truth

54
- "the intrinsic pleasure of creative work derived from a mental phenomenon he calls flow"
- ‎9 elements of flow
- ‎autotelic --> an act worth doing for its own sake

55
- "the maker sees the immediate effect of every step he takes along the way"
- "craft is a process of continuous feedback"

57
- stated goal: "create furniture that manifested simplicity, integrity and grace"

58
- "furniture…is more than an object of contemplation; it is a prescription for the life to be lived around it"
