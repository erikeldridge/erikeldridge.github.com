These are my notes, organized by page, as read through Peter Korn's book _Why We Make Things and Why It Matters_.

53

* "My consciousness comes to inhabit the tip of the knife and the tooth of the saw, so I am not only in the world, but somehow of the world … There is a deep centeredness in trusting one's hands, mind, and imagination to work as a single, well-tuned instrument, a centeredness that touches upon the very essence of fulfillment."
* "learning to do something well for its own sake"
* "‎It is not the hope of achieving game or making money that drives them: rather, it is the opportunity to do the work they enjoy doing." Korn comments this as idealistic, but with an element of truth

54

* "the intrinsic pleasure of creative work derived from a mental phenomenon he calls flow"
* ‎9 elements of flow
* ‎autotelic --> an act worth doing for its own sake

55

* "the maker sees the immediate effect of every step he takes along the way"
* "craft is a process of continuous feedback"

57

* stated goal: "create furniture that manifested simplicity, integrity and grace"

58

* "furniture…is more than an object of contemplation; it is a prescription for the life to be lived around it"
* "We are beings for whom objects have spiritual weight ... A single piece of furniture articulates a point of view about life on many levels"

59

* "Consumerism promises spiritual and emotional fulfillment through acquisition" <-- Korn is to furniture making what Wendell Berry is to farming
* "... the physical details of \[a crafted object\] speak to a more ancient materialism ... the belief that objects have mana: that the miraculous power to provide spiritual sustenance resides in the object itself, not in the achievement of ownership"
* "... the making of the desk was a multilayered process of thinking with things."

60

* "To the human mind, where thoughts spring up unheralded only to vanish just as capriciously ..."
* "... each completed work becomes a springboard for the genesis of its successors" <-- Reminds me of an earlier statement re crafted objects attesting to a craftworker's skill
