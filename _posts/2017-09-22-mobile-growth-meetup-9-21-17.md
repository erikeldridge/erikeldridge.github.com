## Meta

Here are my notes from the [Mobile Growth meetup on 9/21/17](https://www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-Mobile-Growth-Hackers/events/242833756/i/gh_new_rsvp_tl). Branch has been running these for a couple years. The two I've attended have been well-organized and -attended. This one was at Microsoft's office in the Twitter building.

## Notes

### Intro

- Pitch for [2017 Mobile Growth handbook](https://www2.branch.io/MobileGrowthHandbook2017.html)
- Panelists from Criteo, The League, Laughly and Box

### What's worked?

- Using a wait-list to alleviate cold start; complete profile to advance in list
- Providing VIPs with promo urls that point at their profile. This drives downloads and enables warm signup
- Targeting individuals for trip-appropriate travel ads based on their check-out dates
- Providing teen demographic with feedback features, eg "likes", increased retention by 5%

### How to get users?

- Maximize free, organic stuff first, as opposed to buying keywords, then layer "marketing mix" (paid marketing channels) on top (to get "halo effect"), ie pr > ads
- All news is good news in early days. Being exclusive is ok. People complaining is ok
- Facebook ads accounted for 20% traffic
- Have 2-3 marketing channels to account for fluctuating performance. Continuously try new channels

### What didn't work?

- Test performance of pics on app store listing
- Celebrities are well known, so using their pics is tempting, but usage without permission implies endorsement and they may take action

### Reengagement & overlooked metric?

- App quality
- Minimize registration requirements. How much info can you capture later? Reducing one field can have a big impact. Prioritize input hints and assistance before paid marketing
- Try requesting push earlier; not first, but not last, eg so you can push "We didn't mean $3.99. We meant $2.99"
- Ask for easy things first, which will help people feel invested and more likely to grant hard things later

### Metrics to obsess over?

- Product quality
- Predictive churn
- Make it hard to cancel, eg at least ask why

### Thoughts on iOS 11?

- In-app purchases process is better
- Live photos, which are easier to produce than video and more compelling than still
- Getting featured in app store is no longer make/break for business

### Cause of FB acquisition performance change?

- This was regarding "How to get users?" answer above mentioning performance fluctuation
- Unclear, but timing corresponded with new FB interstitial when exiting app, eg to app store

### Snapchat ads?

- To early to tell

### Google's UAC campaign?

- One panelist didn't use Google ads because FB CPI is lower

### How to reengage users who don't create account?

- Low involvement indicates low intent and will be expensive to reengage
- Request push earlier in registration
- Collect retargeting info on app install and then use ads to drive registration completion

### How to AB test frequently?

- This was regarding Laughly's two-week experiment cycle
- Only test one thing at a time. Literally, only one variation in the app every two weeks (to reduce noise). <-- my top takeaway. Presumably this also reduces engineering complexity and improves UX consistency

### Top recommendation?

- Experiment & fail fast
- Prioritize feature requests from users
- Test new marketing channels
- Acquisition & retention are the same
