title: thoughts on using Twitter for blog comments

## Preamble

I want a way for readers to provide feedback and ask questions. I think Twitter might provide an elegant, though imperfect, solution. I'm experimenting with it via a tweet box at the bottom of each blog post.

## Plus

* Twitter is simple
* Twitter is responsible for filtering spam
* I use Twitter all the time, so it's direct (for me)

## Neutral

* Comments persist on Twitter instead of on the blog
* Comments are limited in size

## Minus

* Anyone wanting to comment must use Twitter

## Discussion

I really like the simplicity of using a single platform for communication. I use Twitter actively, so it comes to mind as the single platform to use.

However, I understand that folks preferring other platforms, e.g., Facebook, conventional blog comments, etc., may find it relatively difficult to communicate this way.

Something to think about...
