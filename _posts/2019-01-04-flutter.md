Notes from working with Flutter.

## Non-plugin native code

Problem: I want to prototype logic requiring native integration, eg service disco in iOS, before investing in plugin abstraction.

Solution: [Flutter provides an RPC abstraction](https://flutter.io/docs/development/platform-integration/platform-channels), so we can add native code per-platform, switching on method name.
