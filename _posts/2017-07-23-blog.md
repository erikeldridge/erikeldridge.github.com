## Motivation

I like the idea of shared learning and working together as a team, in a way that's portable across employers.

[Prakhar](https://github.com/prakhar1989) pointed me at [Nathan Marz's post on blogging](http://nathanmarz.com/blog/you-should-blog-even-if-you-have-no-readers.html), which provides excellent motivation specific to blogging.

[Megha](https://twitter.com/megha) shared her experience at [Write/Speak/Code](http://www.writespeakcode.com/), which recommends professional writing as an essential aspect of career development.

I'm inspired by the [meta-knowledge community on Github](https://github.com/RichardLitt/meta-knowledge).

## Approach

I like Github pages for a couple reasons:

* Jekyll provides all the functionality I need
* The content I produce can be easily exported
