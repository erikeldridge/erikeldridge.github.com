# Adventures in blogging

## Motivation

Primarily, I like the idea of shared learning and working as a team.

[Nathan Marz's post on blogging](http://nathanmarz.com/blog/you-should-blog-even-if-you-have-no-readers.html) provides excellent motivation specific to blogging.

I'm inspired by the [meta-knowledge community on Github](https://github.com/RichardLitt/meta-knowledge).

## Approach

I like Github pages for a couple reasons:

* Jekyll provides all the functionality I need
* The content I produce can be easily exported
