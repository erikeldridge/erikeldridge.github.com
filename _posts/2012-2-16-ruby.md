## Ruby

### Rails debugging

* `reload!` to reload a rails app running via script/console
* [Rails debugging reference](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/debugging_rails_applications.html#step-by-step)

#### Where am I?

* `list, l` to see next ten lines of context
* `list-, l-` to see the previous ten lines of context
* `list=, l=` to see the current context

#### How did I get here?

* `backtrace, bt, where` to see the call stack
* `frame {n}` to inspect a specific call in the stack
* `up`/`down` to move up/down the call stack

#### Stepping into and over

* `step, s` to step into
* `next` to step out/over

#### Breakpoints

* `break {n}, b {n}` to set a breakpoint at a specific line number (use `list` to see line numbers)
* `break {path}:{n}` to set a breakpoint at a specific line number in a file
* `info break, info b` to show breakpoints
* `continue, c` to continue to the next breakpoint

#### What's that?

* `e, p` to print the value of a variable
* `pp` to pretty-print a variable
* `irb` to start an irb session (`quit` to exit the session)
