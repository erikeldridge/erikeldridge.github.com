## Motivation

I like the idea of shared learning and working together as a team, in a way that's portable across employers.

[Prakhar](https://github.com/prakhar1989) pointed me at [Nathan Marz's post on blogging](http://nathanmarz.com/blog/you-should-blog-even-if-you-have-no-readers.html), which provides excellent motivation specific to blogging.

[Megha](https://twitter.com/megha) shared her experience at [Write/Speak/Code](http://www.writespeakcode.com/), which recommends professional writing as an essential aspect of career development. (Write/Speak/Code also brought [Open Source Misfeasance](https://zachholman.com/talk/open-source-misfeasance/) to my awareness üëç esp the slide "open source is like being an adult - it seems magical until you realize nobody knows what the hell they're doing." :)

I'm inspired by the [meta-knowledge community on Github](https://github.com/RichardLitt/meta-knowledge).

## Approach

### Platform

I like Github pages for a couple reasons:

* Jekyll provides all the functionality I need
* The content I produce can be easily exported

### Discovery

Github Pages are conceptually simple in part because functionality is constrained on the server-side.

Ideally, I could provide full text search, but doing so without a server requires either a heavy client or an external vendor. External vendors with free offerings usually want UI control as compensation and I'd prefer full control.

With this set of constraints, and given I only have a little content, a simple regex filter seems appropriate.

I sort content by last modified and enable filtration by date.

### Content management

I use [Forestry](https://forestry.io) as a CMS in front of Github Pages to simplify content capture.

Pros

* Nice editor, error logging and docs
* Relatively easy date maintenance (delete and let it auto-populate), for the sorting mentioned above
* Stable business model

Cons

* Nothing significant, but it'd be nice if the editor had more space, eg collapse the side menus

Alternatives

* Siteleaf is good, but doesn't provide preview in free mode
* I tried Prose.io in the past, but saving content was flaky
* I plan to revisit jekyll-admin if/when it's [supported by Github Pages](https://stackoverflow.com/a/42401902/1971682)
