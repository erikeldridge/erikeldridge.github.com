New York magazine's May 2018 issue contained an [excellent summary of Yale's How to be Happy course](https://www.thecut.com/2018/05/how-to-be-happy.html "NYMag: How to be Happy: a cheat sheet"). I've been thinking about and sharing it ever since reading it.

With respect to software engineering and product development, I wonder if defining a core value for "building things that make people happy" would help us bias toward engineering products that are constructive for humanity.

The psychology of habit described by Nir Eyal's _Hooked_ helped us structure features to be rewarding. I'd like to experiment w using a similar approach to structure features conducive to happiness.
