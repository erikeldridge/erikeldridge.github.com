Abraham Maslow described a [hierarchy of needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs "Wikipedia: Maslow's hierarchy of needs") required by a person to live life fully.

In the workplace, it's hard to perform at a high level when I'm worried about the viability of the company, my role on a team, compensation and tax complexity, [engineering safety](play "My notes on play"), etc.

This pattern emerges so often, I think it's worth considering as a core value, eg "We recognize the importance of self-actualization and a hierarchy of needs."
