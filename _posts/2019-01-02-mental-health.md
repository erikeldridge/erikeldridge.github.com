Here are some things I've found helpful when life feels like a rat race.

Being in nature, even if it's just appreciating plants growing near home or work.

Consciously seeking out community, even if it's just buying stuff from a store instead of online.

Sleeping.

Avoiding tech, eg staying off social media, preferring books to movies, etc.

_Experience Life_ magazine consistently provides simple, helpful, non-commercial, pragmatic tips for health maintenance, eg [The Way of the Healthy Deviant](https://experiencelife.com/article/the-way-of-the-healthy-deviant/).

Reading Michael Pollan's _How to Change Your Mind_ puts me in a meditative mood.
