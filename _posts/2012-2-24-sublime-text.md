Install [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2).

## Package Control

The first thing to do after installing sublime text is install [package control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control).

After it's installed, we can bring up the command menu via `shift + âŒ˜ + P`, search for an installed package by name, and run the package by hitting return.

## JSHint package

JSHint is like a less-opinionated JSLint. Find and install it via package control

## Command line

Sublime Text's command line tool is handy for opening a directory in the editor from the command line. Setup instructions are provided on the [Sublime Text OS X command line docs](http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/osx_command_line.html).

* Open current dir: `subl .`
* Open gem directory in sublime text: `subl \`bundle show decider\``
