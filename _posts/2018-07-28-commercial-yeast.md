This is an experiment in using commercial yeast.

I picked Red Star Premier Blanc, a champagne yeast, because I like dry cider.

I'm also adding Wyeast Beer Nutrient Blend based on frequent references in online cider resources to adding yeast nutrient, and this product seemed to have nice stuff in it.

I bought both off Amazon, in addition to an air lock appropriate for a 1 gallon apple juice bottle. I chose a single chamber air lock because that's what a friend lent me before, and I appreciate the simplicity.

The yeast packet recommended starting the yeast in a quarter cup of 95°F to 100°F water. I didn't want to dilute the juice, so I used juice instead of water.

Microwaving a quarter cup of liquid for thirty seconds brought it to \~100°, measured using a Thermopen.

The 5 gram yeast packet contained enough for five gallons, so I measured \~2 grams using my wife's baking scale.

The scale didn't support fractional grams, so I just added a dash of yeast nutrient.

I microwaved a quarter cup of juice and pitched the yeast and nutrient in.

Within a couple minutes the yeast started bubbling! This was very different from wild yeasting where I'd wait for a few days before anything happened.

After the 20 minutes recommended by the yeast packet, I poured the yeast slurry into the juice in the 1 gallon jug and fitted the airlock, sanitized by wiping with a vodka-soaked paper towel.

I still prefer the informal approach of wild yeasting, but am looking forward to a more fully fermented cider.

In future, I'd like to experiment with wild yeasting a starter, and if it tastes good, using that with the process described above for full fermentation.
