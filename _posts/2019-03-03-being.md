I get the impression we are literally parts of one being.

The United States has a motto E pluribus unum, which is latin for "out of many, one."

In the [1972 movie Solaris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_(1972_film) "Wikipedia page for the 1972 Solaris movie") (and presumably the book it's based on), the ocean and the humans floating on it interact deeply.

Acupuncture has a notion of chi, which is freely available.

"Yoga means union", a phrase I attribute to the community around Paramahansa Yogananda.

In _Fourth Uncle in the Mountain_ by Marjorie Pivar and Quang Van Nguyen, the uncle says anything that comes to mind in meditation is a distraction, but doesn't say what it's a distraction from.

The [On Being podcast](https://onbeing.org/series/podcast/ "The On Being podcast web site") seems appropriate to mention here, though I haven't yet come across an episode specifically mentioning the notion of unity.
