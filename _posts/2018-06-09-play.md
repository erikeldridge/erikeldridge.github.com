It's hackweek this week. We're working efficiently, and, as usual, I'm wondering why more of work isn't like this.

Proposal: define a core value around "work should feel like play"; we're doing something wrong if we don't have freedom to explore, and/or are distracted by unmet basic needs.

Given safety is a critical part of actualization, eng, org, legal, etc guardrails should be first-class. Within these boundaries we should be free to interact with customers and play with features.

Concrete example: an alpha release pool should be an infra feature available to every team.

I think this would take pressure of subjective aspects of code review, and provide more definition for architectural review.

This seems a lot like [Maslow's hierarchy](maslow "My notes on Maslow"); we have to establish our basic needs, like safety, before we can perform at a high-level.

Aside: I wonder if child's play is a form of self-actualization, which may be why [kid's who aren't allowed to play have a difficult time as adults](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2011/10/all-work-and-no-play-why-your-kids-are-more-anxious-depressed/246422/ "Atlantic article on research regarding free play"). Perhaps this is due to lack of experience with self-actualization.
