Bureaucracy, as delegated authority, has a role, but can be frustrating to work with. Influencing that authority requires focus, organization and patience.  
  
LaDonna Harris identified the importance of focus and organization in her work to raise awareness of and support for indigenous people, as documented in [LaDonna Harris: Indian 101](http://www.pbs.org/video/ladonna-harris-indian-101-full-episode/).  
  
I'd humbly add patience to the list. Nothing moves quickly in a bureaucracy. Pushing for fast action burns everyone out. Expanding my timeline generally seems to be the solution when I'm stressed about the pace of a project.

Focused, sustained pressure over time seems to be the way. To quote [Haile Selassie, in his 1963 address to the United Nations](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Haile_Selassie%27s_address_to_the_United_Nations,_1963), popularized by [Bob Marley's "War"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPZydAotVOY): "we know that we shall win, as we are confident in the victory of good over evil."
