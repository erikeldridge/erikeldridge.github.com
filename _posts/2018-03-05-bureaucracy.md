# Problem statement

Bureaucracy, as delegated authority, has a role, but can be frustrating to work with.

# Solutions

## Focus & organization

LaDonna Harris identified the importance of focus and organization in her work to raise awareness of and support for indigenous people, as documented in [LaDonna Harris: Indian 101](http://www.pbs.org/video/ladonna-harris-indian-101-full-episode/).

## Patience

Nothing moves quickly in a bureaucracy. Pushing for fast action burns everyone out. Expanding my timeline generally seems to be the solution when I'm stressed about the pace of a project.

To quote [Haile Selassie, in his 1963 address to the United Nations](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Haile_Selassie%27s_address_to_the_United_Nations,_1963), popularized by [Bob Marley's "War"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPZydAotVOY): "we know that we shall win, as we are confident in the victory of good over evil."

## Locality

Another thing that helps is decreasing the scope of a change. If it takes too much effort to gain permission to publish an idea on a shared blog, I publish on my own, and then use that to gain support.

## Forgiveness

I've heard the phrase "Asking for forgiveness is easier than asking for permission." The most significant application I've seen is with respect to alleviating bureaucracy: I was frustrated by required attendance at a pointless meeting and my manager advised simply not attending. This immediately reduced pressure, which leads me to wonder if we can generalize: if something is causing pain, stop doing it, and then deal with the fallout (if any).
