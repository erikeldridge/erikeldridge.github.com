## Git

* Create branch: `git checkout -b ma_branch`
* Delete remote branch: `git push origin :ma_branch_to_delete`
* Fetch latest master from origin, but don't merge:
  1. `git fetch origin`
  1. `git merge origin/master`
* Fetch and merge latest from master: `git pull origin master`
* Resolve merge conflicts
  1. fix issue
  1. `git add .`
  1. `git commit`
  1. save commit w/o message
* Use .gitignore to avoid checking in files unnecessary for the project
* Checkout individual file from external branch. `git checkout <branch> -- <path>`. The -- helps git avoid confusion by separating branch from paths. Also useful for git reset --hard on a single file. Note: this does not merge, ie history is lost
* Revert to specific commit (as a new commit): `git revert <sha>`
* Diff w/ stash: `git diff stash@{0}`
* Diff two branches: `git diff <branch 1>..<branch 2>`
* See branch details: `git branch -vv`
* Only show your commits: `git diff master..head --no-merges`
* Use gui to only show your commits: `git difftool master..head --no-merges`
* See which files have changed between two branches: `git diff --name-only head..origin/master`
* Unstage a single file: `git reset HEAD <file>`
* View a single file in a given commit: `git show <sha>:<path>`
* [GitX]() is a handy for live editing staged changes
* Determine if branch exists on remote repo: `git log <remote name>/<branch name>`
* Revision-specific blame: `git blame <sha> -- <path>`. Useful if global change assigns ownership for all lines to one user
