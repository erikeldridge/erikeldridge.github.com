## RubyMine/Intellij Learnings

* The [Vim key bindings](http://plugins.intellij.net/plugin/?ruby&id=164) allow me to use a common syntax for IDE and command-line editing.
* The [Mac OS X 10.5+ keymap](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/documentation/index.jsp) defines a set of intuitive keybindings
* An [SSD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive) will greatly increase Intellij's responsiveness
* Search > Find Action... (cmd + shift + A) is helpful for finding an action based on its menu item name
* Go To > File (cmd + shift + O) for searching for files by name
* View > Recent Files (cmd + E) to navigate recently opened files
* [Merge tool](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/features/local_history.html) visualizises changes to merge and provides editable merged state
* [Local history](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/features/local_history.html) can help recover changes lost via bad commit
