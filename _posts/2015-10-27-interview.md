## Goal

Define exercises candidate and interviewers can use evaluate fit


## Overview

Flow:

1. Candidate applies
1. Recruiter evaluates fit
1. Recruiter sends candidate at-home assignment
1. Candidate completes assignment
1. Eng team evaluates assignment
1. If borderline, eng team discusses assignment with candidate via phone
1. Recruiter schedules on-site interview and defines interview panel
1. Candidate visits location for on-site interview
1. Eng team works with candidate to add a new feature to at-home assignment
1. EM meets with candidate to discuss work history
1. Interview panel grades interview immediately afterward
1. If borderline, panel meets to discuss

At-home assignment better approximates actual work than coding in a shared editor during a phone call

On-site extension of assignment provides continuity for candidate, and better approximates actual work than whiteboard coding


## Panel construction

Prefer dedicated days, eg we interview on Mondays and Fridays, to provide predictability for panel members

Prefer back-to-back interviews to minimize context switching and maximize relative grading

Assign questions during panel construction to minimize coordination requirements
