I recently discovered the [agile principles](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) address simplicity: "Simplicity -- the art of maximizing the amountÂ of work not done -- is essential."

In the context of building, I'm attracted to simplicity for a few reasons.

The less we build, the faster we ship. Customers get their features for minimal cost. Builders get more time to rest.

We only need to maintain what we build. Given entropy, everything we build requires constant maintenance. How can we meet our needs with minimal maintenance cost?

As a geology professor once said, "gravity is pulling everything down to sea level." We can work to ensure our inevitable failures are graceful.
