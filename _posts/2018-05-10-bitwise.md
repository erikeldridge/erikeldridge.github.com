## Context

I have a legacy identifier with a reference implementation is JS. I need to generate IDs in Java.

I rarely have to think about bitwise operations, so this problem started out frustrating, but I developed an appreciation for the elegance of binary, hex and bitwise operations as I warmed up, and was reluctant to trade them in for the relatively self-documenting Java syntax at the end.

## JS

We use an [array of 8-bit, unsigned ints](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Int8Array):

    var ints = new Uint8Array(8)

Presumably, we're using unsigned ints so we can encode

We populate this array with random values:

    window.crypto.getRandomValues(ints)

We get the last (random) 4 bits of the first byte using the AND operator against 1111 (0xF in hex):

    var rand = 0xF & ints[0]

We prepend 0111 by adding 011100000 (0x70 in hex):

    ints[0] = 0x70 + rand

I think this may be due to max long in Java, ie `Long.MAX_VALUE == 0x7FFF_FFFF_FFFF_FFFFL`.

We convert this to an array of chars using and then base64 encode:

    btoa(String.fromCharCode(...ints))

I think the base64 encoding is to retain the integrity of the "bytes".

Sanity:

    > atob("ekMJT1sVNBc=").split('').map(c=>c.charCodeAt(0))
    < [122, 67, 9, 79, 91, 21, 52, 23]

## Java

Java makes this easier with native 64 bit long, byte primitives and convenience classes. [Java REPL](http://www.javarepl.com/) makes it easy to hack around.

### Decode

For sanity, can we decode the value produced by JS?

    import java.nio.ByteBuffer
    import java.util.Base64
    String encoded = "ekMJT1sVNBc="
    byte[] bytes = Base64.getDecoder().decode(encoded)
    long id = ByteBuffer.wrap(bytes).getLong()

### Encode

Generate a random long within a range 0x7...:

    import java.util.Random
    long id = new Random().longs(0x7000_0000_0000_0000L, Long.MAX_VALUE).limit(1).findFirst().getAsLong()

Convert to bytes:

    byte[] bytes = ByteBuffer.allocate(Long.BYTES).putLong(id).array()

Note this method produces values outside the range 0-255, eg:

    < byte[] bytes = [116, 91, -54, -35, -92, -103, 127, -28]
    > Integer.toHexString(bytes[2])
    < "ffffffca"

I suspect ID generation originated in Java as random unsigned longs, was replicated in JS

Encode:

    Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(bytes)

Sanity:

    Long.toHexString(id)
    Long.toBinaryString(id)
