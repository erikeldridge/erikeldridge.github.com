## Academic advisory

This post is written for a faculty audience, and targets CS programs.

I develop web applications using open-source tools, so my recommendations skew toward that industry and tool set.

This post describes several activities students can participate in to develop practical developer skills, meet like-minded people in the developer community, and meet employees from local companies. If there are an abundance of these activities nearby, schools can encourage students to participate. If not, schools can host these events themselves and support students by building a developer community around the school.

### Tools

#### Github

I recommend all students create a github account for a few reasons:

* Github is a great product and it's free
* Github recognizes the social aspects of software development and provides tools for working collaboratively and discovering like-minded developers
* Having code online provides recruiting teams with a way to assess a student's skill level

*Note:* encourage students to be vigilent about maintaining the code that is viewable online. We want a recruiter's first impression to be a good one.

#### Java

I recommend students have awareness of a variety of compiled languages, but develop proficiency in one. Based on my experience, I would recommend Java. A student should be able to say "I am proficient writing, reading, testing, and debugging in Java".

#### Python

As with compiled languages, I recommend students have exposure to several, but develop proficiency in Python. Python is a widely used tool for a variety of applications from system scripting to web app development, and its terse, self-descriptive syntax makes it convenient for interview whiteboarding. It is close enough conceptually and syntactically to Ruby, PHP, and JavaScript that a student can compete effectively for roles using any of these.

#### Reading, testing, debugging

Interns and new grads generally have very little experience reading other people's code, testing, or debugging. This is quickly picked up on the job, but a student with some experience can provide a competitive application for a given role. The goal is to make it easy for an interviewer to imagine working with the student. The closer a student is to being a productive member of the team, the better.

For reviewing code, I recommend [reviewboard](http://www.reviewboard.org/). Github also provides [review tools](https://github.com/features/projects/codereview), though I don't have experience with them.

For testing, I recommend a basic unit test framework such as Java's [JUnit](http://www.junit.org/) and Python's [PyUnit](http://docs.python.org/library/unittest.html).

For debugging, I recommend [jdb](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.3/docs/tooldocs/solaris/jdb.html) or [gdb](http://gcc.gnu.org/java/gdb.html) on the command-line or via an IDE.

### Activities

#### Hack days

A [hack day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hack_Day) is a day devoted to creating and launching something that, for whatever reason, isn't on the roadmap, i.e., if you had a day to build anything, what would it be?  Some hack days have a contest at the end. Yahoo! runs hack days around the world that often span a weekend. Twitter just ran an internal hack event that lasted a week.

Given the limited timeframe, producing a functional proof of concept is valued over rigor. Developers often work through the night. Social order starts to flex. They're a lot of fun.

Variations on the hack day idea include [Random Hacks of Kindness](http://www.rhok.org/), which provides a way for developers to contribute to disaster relief efforts, and [CityCamp](http://citycamp.govfresh.com/) Hackathons, focused on improving public services.

Hack days are very common within tech companies as a way to foster innovation, identify problem areas, and meet external developers. For example, [Twitter Hack Week](http://engineering.twitter.com/2010/10/hack-week.html), [Facebook Games Hack Day](http://www.eventbrite.com/event/2414110670), and [Yahoo!'s Open Hack India](http://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/ydn/posts/2011/08/open-hack-india-they-hacked-we-won-them-over/).

Participation goals:

* students work closely with engineers from host companies
* school stimulates local developer community
* students can concievably launch a product

Costs:

* participants bring whatever tech they require, e.g., laptops, mobile devices, hardware, etc.
* hosts provide space and usually food
* admission is usually free

#### BarCamp

A BarCamp is a self-organizing conference, a.k.a., an [unconference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference). Everyone is welcome, and anyone can propose a talk. A great assignment would be to attend a local BarCamp, present a brief talk on an area of interest, and report on the experience.

[The official BarCamp site](http://barcamp.org/) maintains a list of upcoming BarCamps, and links to helpful resources for running a BarCamp.

If you are hosting a camp, survey students to see which employers are the most sought-after, and then reach out to those companies for space and/or sponsorship. In addition to recieving assistance, the sponsor may insist on representation at the event, putting students in direct, but low-stress contact with employees, who are often engineers themselves.

Participation goals:

* work closely with engineers from host companies
* stimulate local developer community
* concievably launch a product

Costs:

* admission is usually cheap
* hosts provide space, at a minimum

#### Tech talks

Tech talks are a great way for students to learn about interesting and novel technologies, meet representatives from the company or school hosting the talk, and meet other like-minded developers from the local community. I recommend all universities encourage students to attend talks, and/or experiment with hosting talks.

Getting started:

1. search [meetup.com](http://meetup.com) for a topic related to any area of the curriculum requiring support
1. attend a meeting to get a feel for the group
1. suggest a meetup at your location

Participation goals:

* learn about given technology
* meet developers in a community
* meet employees at host companies

#### CoderDojo

From [the CoderDojo website's about page](http://coderdojo.com/about-us/)

> CoderDojo is a movement orientated around running free not-for-profit coding clubs and regular sessions for young people.

> At a CoderDojo, young people learn how to code, develop websites, apps, programs, games and more. Dojos are set up, run by and taught at by volunteers. Dojos organise tours of technology companies, bring in guest speakers to talk about their career and what they do, and organise events. In addition to learning to code, members meet like minded people, show off what theyâ€™ve been working on and so on. CoderDojo makes development and learning to code a fun, sociable, kick ass experience. CoderDojo also puts a strong emphasis on open source and free software, and has a strong network of members and volunteers globally.

As in a school for martial arts, CoderDojo defines a set of [belts](http://coderdojo.com/about-us/belt-rankings/) (white, yellow, red, black) for coding ability. Students ascend in rank by learning technologies and skill-sets such as JavaScript, Python, game development, and mentorship.

CoderDojo started in Ireland, but has since spread around the world. The website maintains a list of locations. If there isn't one in your area, consider [starting a dojo](http://coderdojo.com/help-us/i-want-to-start-a-coderdojo-right-now/) for students and/or the community.

Participation goals:

 * define and develop a standard set of skills
 * promote a healthy developer community associated with the school hosting a CoderDojo
 * integrate with an international developer community

Costs:

* hosts provide space and teachers
* participants may need a laptop

#### Programming competitions


The [ACM International Collegiate programming contest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACM_International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest) and the [International Olympiad in Informatics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympiad_in_Informatics) are two international programming competitions.

I don't have experience in eithor of the above as a competitor, but I have interviewed people with experience, and they generally perform very well.

#### Participation goals

* broad exposure to classic and contemporary CS problems
* experience solving problems under pressure, which can be helpful preparation for the interview process
* experience working with a team, and integrating with a larger developer community
