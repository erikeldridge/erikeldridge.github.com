## Academic advisory

This post is written for a faculty audience, and targets CS programs.

I develop web applications using open-source tools, so my recommendations are informed by that industry and tool set.

### Motivation

Above all else, I recommend helping students discover and explore their interests, so they can then compete effectively for jobs aligned with those interests. Hopefully, each student will find a career in which she loves going to work, and derives real, personal value from her contribution.

To perform well in an interview and in the workplace, we have to demonstrate passion for the role. A dispassionate applicant may possess exceptional technical skill and be passed over for someone with less experience, but a strong sense for the product and a motivation to learn.

I recommend asking students regularly to describe what they would like to learn about, and include the resulting feedback in an academic advisory setting. For example, suppose 70% of students studying mobile development would prefer to focus on the Android platform over iOS. If it's all the same to the academic advisory panel, we could increase the relevancy of the curiculum by accomodating and supporting this interest.

### Community

By fostering interaction with a diversity of people and ideas, a school can help a student refine her career goals. By including employers in this interaction, a school can expose students directly, and under the best of circumstances, with employment opportunities.

LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, and Github provide online tools for interacting online with other developers. There are also several activities in which students can participate to learn practical skills, meet like-minded people in the developer community, and meet employees from local companies. If there are an abundance of these activities nearby, schools can encourage students to participate. If not, schools can host these events themselves and support students by building a developer community around the school.

#### LinkedIn

I recommend students create a [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/) profile and populate it fully. Recruiters pay LinkedIn for access to profiles. By maintaining a profile, students are proactively providing recruiters with the most up-to-date professional description of themselves.

LinkedIn is also convenient for keeping in touch with colleagues, and contacting them descretely regarding employment opportunities. I recommend students connect with professors, and the students they would be willing to work with.

#### Twitter, Facebook, and Github

I recommend students use these services to listen to the thoughts of people in industry, and reduce the perceived distance between the worlds of academia and industry. This is especially relevant if the student is literally far away from the geographic area in which he would like to work.

For example, suppose a student would love to build mobile applications for Twitter. I would recommend he:

1. search for "twitter java open source"
1. Twitter maintains several projects via Github
1. find all the people listed under "Organization Members" on Twitter's Github page
1. follow all of them on Github and Twitter

By listening in on a group of people like this, the student will have a much better sense for the Twitter engineering community, and whether or not it's focused on his areas of interest.

#### Hack days

A [hack day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hack_Day) is a day devoted to creating and launching something that, for whatever reason, isn't on the roadmap, i.e., if you had a day to build anything, what would it be?  Some hack days have a contest at the end. Yahoo! runs hack days around the world that often span a weekend. Twitter just ran an internal hack event that lasted a week.

Given the limited timeframe, producing a functional proof of concept is valued over rigor. Developers often work through the night. Social order starts to flex. They're a lot of fun.

Variations on the hack day idea include [Random Hacks of Kindness](http://www.rhok.org/), which provides a way for developers to contribute to disaster relief efforts, and [CityCamp](http://citycamp.govfresh.com/) Hackathons, focused on improving public services.

Hack days are very common within tech companies as a way to foster innovation, identify problem areas, and meet external developers. For example, [Twitter Hack Week](http://engineering.twitter.com/2010/10/hack-week.html), [Facebook Games Hack Day](http://www.eventbrite.com/event/2414110670), and [Yahoo!'s Open Hack India](http://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/ydn/posts/2011/08/open-hack-india-they-hacked-we-won-them-over/).

Participation goals:

* students work closely with engineers from host companies
* school stimulates local developer community
* students can concievably launch a product

Costs:

* participants bring whatever tech they require, e.g., laptops, mobile devices, hardware, etc.
* hosts provide space and usually food
* admission is usually free

#### BarCamp

A BarCamp is a self-organizing conference, a.k.a., an [unconference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference). Everyone is welcome, and anyone can propose a talk. A great assignment would be to attend a local BarCamp, present a brief talk on an area of interest, and report on the experience.

[The official BarCamp site](http://barcamp.org/) maintains a list of upcoming BarCamps, and links to helpful resources for running a BarCamp.

If you are hosting a camp, survey students to see which employers are the most sought-after, and then reach out to those companies for space and/or sponsorship. In addition to recieving assistance, the sponsor may insist on representation at the event, putting students in direct, but low-stress contact with employees, who are often engineers themselves.

Participation goals:

* work closely with engineers from host companies
* stimulate local developer community
* concievably launch a product

Costs:

* admission is usually cheap
* hosts provide space, at a minimum

#### Tech talks

Tech talks are a great way for students to learn about interesting and novel technologies, meet representatives from the company or school hosting the talk, and meet other like-minded developers from the local community. I recommend all universities encourage students to attend talks, and/or experiment with hosting talks.

Getting started:

1. search [meetup.com](http://meetup.com) for a topic related to any area of the curriculum requiring support
1. attend a meeting to get a feel for the group
1. suggest a meetup at your location

Participation goals:

* learn about given technology
* meet developers in a community
* meet employees at host companies

#### CoderDojo

From [the CoderDojo website's about page](http://coderdojo.com/about-us/)

> CoderDojo is a movement orientated around running free not-for-profit coding clubs and regular sessions for young people.

> At a CoderDojo, young people learn how to code, develop websites, apps, programs, games and more. Dojos are set up, run by and taught at by volunteers. Dojos organise tours of technology companies, bring in guest speakers to talk about their career and what they do, and organise events. In addition to learning to code, members meet like minded people, show off what theyâ€™ve been working on and so on. CoderDojo makes development and learning to code a fun, sociable, kick ass experience. CoderDojo also puts a strong emphasis on open source and free software, and has a strong network of members and volunteers globally.

As in a school for martial arts, CoderDojo defines a set of [belts](http://coderdojo.com/about-us/belt-rankings/) (white, yellow, red, black) for coding ability. Students ascend in rank by learning technologies and skill-sets such as JavaScript, Python, game development, and mentorship.

CoderDojo started in Ireland, but has since spread around the world. The website maintains a list of locations. If there isn't one in your area, consider [starting a dojo](http://coderdojo.com/help-us/i-want-to-start-a-coderdojo-right-now/) for students and/or the community.

Participation goals:

 * define and develop a standard set of skills
 * promote a healthy developer community associated with the school hosting a CoderDojo
 * integrate with an international developer community

Costs:

* hosts provide space and teachers
* participants may need a laptop

#### Programming competitions


The [ACM International Collegiate programming contest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACM_International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest) and the [International Olympiad in Informatics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympiad_in_Informatics) are two international programming competitions.

I don't have experience in eithor of the above as a competitor, but I have interviewed people with experience, and they generally perform very well.

Participation goals:

* broad exposure to classic and contemporary CS problems
* experience solving problems under pressure, which can be helpful preparation for the interview process
* experience working with a team, and integrating with a larger developer community

### Tools

#### Java

I recommend students have awareness of a variety of compiled languages, but develop proficiency in one. Based on my experience, I would recommend Java. A student should be able to say "I am proficient in writing, reading, testing, and debugging in Java".

#### Python

As with compiled languages, I recommend students have exposure to several, but develop proficiency in Python. Python is a widely used tool for a variety of applications from system scripting to web app development, and its terse, self-descriptive syntax makes it convenient for interview whiteboarding. It is close enough conceptually and syntactically to Ruby, PHP, and JavaScript that a student can compete effectively for roles using any of these.

#### Reading, testing, debugging, committing

Interns and new grads generally have very little experience reading other people's code, testing, debugging, or working with a source control tool. This is quickly picked up on the job, but a student with some experience has a competitive advantage for a given role. The goal is to make it easy for an interviewer to imagine working with the student. The closer a student is to being a productive member of the team, the better.

For reviewing code, I recommend [reviewboard](http://www.reviewboard.org/). Github also provides [review tools](https://github.com/features/projects/codereview), though I don't have experience with them.

For testing, I recommend a basic unit test framework such as Java's [JUnit](http://www.junit.org/) and Python's [PyUnit](http://docs.python.org/library/unittest.html).

For debugging, I recommend [jdb](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.3/docs/tooldocs/solaris/jdb.html) or [gdb](http://gcc.gnu.org/java/gdb.html) on the command-line or via an IDE.

For source control, I recommend [git](http://git-scm.com/) for a few reasons:

* git is a free, modern tool, with many nice features, which has been embraced by the developer community
* git is used by many companies and [open-source projects](https://github.com/popular/watched) for source control
* proficiency with git will make interactions with [Github](https://github.com/), which I also recommend, much more straightforward

#### Github

I recommend all students create a [Github](https://github.com/) account for a few reasons:

* Github is a great product and it's free
* Github recognizes the social aspects of software development and provides tools for working collaboratively and discovering like-minded developers
* Having code online provides recruiting teams with a way to assess a student's skill level, especially if the student is geographically remote

**Note:** please encourage students to be vigilent about maintaining the code that is viewable online. We want a recruiter's first impression to be a good one.
