### Hack days

A [hack day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hack_Day) is a day devoted to creating and launching something that, for whatever reason, isn't on the roadmap, i.e., if you had a day to build anything, what would it be?  Some hack days have a contest at the end. Yahoo! runs hack days around the world that often span a weekend. Twitter just ran an internal hack event that lasted a week.

Given the limited timeframe, producing a functional proof of concept is valued over rigor. Developers often work through the night. Social order starts to flex. They're a lot of fun.

Variations on the hack day idea include [Random Hacks of Kindness](http://www.rhok.org/), which provides a way for developers to contribute to disaster relief efforts, and [CityCamp](http://citycamp.govfresh.com/) Hackathons, focused on improving public services.

Hack days are very common within tech companies as a way to foster innovation, identify problem areas, and meet external developers. For example, [Twitter Hack Week](http://engineering.twitter.com/2010/10/hack-week.html), [Facebook Games Hack Day](http://www.eventbrite.com/event/2414110670), and [Yahoo!'s Open Hack India](http://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/ydn/posts/2011/08/open-hack-india-they-hacked-we-won-them-over/).

Participation goals:

* work closely with engineers from host companies
* stimulate local developer community
* concievably launch a product

Cost:

* participants bring whatever tech they require, e.g., laptops, mobile devices, hardware, etc.
* hosts provide space and usually food
* admission is usually free

### BarCamp

A BarCamp is a self-organizing conference, a.k.a., an [unconference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference). Everyone is welcome, and anyone can propose a talk. A great assignment would be to attend a local BarCamp, present a brief talk on an area of interest, and report on the experience.

[The official BarCamp site](http://barcamp.org/) maintains a list of upcoming BarCamps, and links to helpful resources for running a BarCamp.

Participation goals:

* work closely with engineers from host companies
* stimulate local developer community
* concievably launch a product

Cost:

* admission is usually cheap
* hosts provide space, at a minimum

### CoderDojo

From [the CoderDojo website's about page](http://coderdojo.com/about-us/)

> CoderDojo is a movement orientated around running free not-for-profit coding clubs and regular sessions for young people.

> At a CoderDojo, young people learn how to code, develop websites, apps, programs, games and more. Dojos are set up, run by and taught at by volunteers. Dojos organise tours of technology companies, bring in guest speakers to talk about their career and what they do, and organise events. In addition to learning to code, members meet like minded people, show off what theyâ€™ve been working on and so on. CoderDojo makes development and learning to code a fun, sociable, kick ass experience. CoderDojo also puts a strong emphasis on open source and free software, and has a strong network of members and volunteers globally.

As in a school for martial arts, CoderDojo defines a set of [belts](http://coderdojo.com/about-us/belt-rankings/) (white, yellow, red, black) for coding ability. Students ascend in rank by learning technologies and skill-sets such as JavaScript, Python, game development, and mentorship.

CoderDojo started in Ireland, but has since spread around the world. The website maintains a list of locations. If there isn't one in your area, consider [starting a dojo](http://coderdojo.com/help-us/i-want-to-start-a-coderdojo-right-now/) for students and/or the community.

Participation goals:

 * define and develop a standard set of skills
 * promote a healthy developer community associated with the school hosting a CoderDojo
 * integrate with an international developer community

Costs:

* hosts provide space and teachers
* participants may need a laptop

### Programming competitions

The [ACM International Collegiate programming contest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACM_International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest) and the [International Olympiad in Informatics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympiad_in_Informatics) are two international programming competitions.

Participation goals:

* broad exposure to classic and contemporary CS problems
* experience solving problems under pressure, which can be helpful preparation for the interview process
* experience working with a team, and integrating with a larger developer community

Costs:

* admission
*
