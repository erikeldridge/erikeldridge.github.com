General iOS dev notes.

## Peer-to-peer 

Problem: we want to interact with other devices directly rather than over the public internet

Solution: [Implementing Bonjour across iOS and Android](https://jaanus.com/implementing-bonjour-across-ios-and-android/) and [Multipeer Connectivity](https://www.ralfebert.de/ios/tutorials/multipeer-connectivity/) provide good examples.

## Install on device

Problem: the ability to deploy to multiple devices is helpful when developing networked apps

Solution: define a development certificate, as described by https://codewithchris.com/deploy-your-app-on-an-iphone/

## Avoid storyboard complexity

Problem: storyboards hide programmatic complexity behind UI complexity, which is hard to search for

Solution: delete storyboards and plist references, and init view controller in AppDelegate

Related: consider generalizing view logic using something like Flutter

## Detecting simulator

Problem: developing for two devices can require use of simulator and device simultaneously, so how do we differentiate?

Solution: `#if targetEnvironment(simulator)`
