# Problem

How do people in a group feel about the group? How to collect this sentiment in a non-threatening way?

# Solution

Periodically survey to gauge sentiment, eg do you enjoy working here? Can you do your job effectively?

Structure questions to have aggregatable answers, eg yes/no, 1-5, etc. Answers are aggregated and anonymized.

Display data comparatively, eg year-over-year, group vs sub-group.

Display results per leadership level, eg a company might call attention to trend and encourage managers to discuss with their teams.

Google's [googlegeist](https://qz.com/97731/inside-googles-culture-of-relentless-self-surveying/) (breathless article warning) survey is an example. Google also provides [employee survey recommendations](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/analytics-run-an-employee-survey/steps/introduction/).
