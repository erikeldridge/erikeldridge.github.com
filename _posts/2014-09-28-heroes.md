## Clair Patterson

Invented the clean room, discovered the age of the earth, discovered the dangers of leaded gas and fought to ban it.

See [Cosmos, episode 7 ("The Clean Room")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clean_Room), for an excellent introduction.


## Neil deGrasse Tyson

Unabashedly passionate scientest. Host of [Cosmos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos:_A_Spacetime_Odyssey).


## Tim Berners-Lee

Inventor of the world wide web. I believe the web flourishes today in large part
because his technical skill made it accessible and his generosity made it
available to all.
