Before heading out, I searched for "stanford dish mushrooms" to get an idea of what we might see and found [Robert Siegel's photos of fungi at the Dish](https://web.stanford.edu/~siegelr/fungi/dishfungi.html). (Thx, Robert!)

It'd rained earlier in the week and the weather was cool, so I was optimistic.

I was especially curious about the fungus in Siegel's "When fungi mimic scat". I hadn't paid attention to mushrooms of that form before.

At the top of the Dish trail, I saw something that looked like horse poop under an oak by the trail. I picked up a piece. It had a vaguely organic structure, but then I became concerned it might actually be poop, so I moved on :)

A little further, I saw another pile and then another, all under oak. This seemed like too much of a coincidence - hi, [Pisolithus](http://web.stanford.edu/~siegelr/fungi/pisolithus.html) üëãüçÑ

I also saw some clusters of mushrooms with orange caps and white stipes ([Leratiomyces ceres](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/121217-Leratiomyces-ceres)?) growing in the mulch around young oak trees.

Descending, I saw a mushroom with a maroon cap the size of my hand and yellow pores emerging at the base of an oak tree! It looked like [Suillus](https://web.stanford.edu/~siegelr/fungi/suillus.html), but the pores were pale. Scanning for more, I saw another twice the size!

Researching my finds later, I learned Pisolithus is symbiotic and an ingredient in [Fungi Perfecti's MycoGrow](http://www.fungi.com/product-detail/product/mycogrow-soluble-1-oz.html). The fungus looks unconventional, but it's a beneficial member of the garden :)
