Here's a quick list of books I've enjoyed, in alpha order.

Note: I bias toward the humorous, humane and irreverent; mystical and military.

_1984_ by George Orwell.

_Afterparty_ by Daryl Gregory.

_Ancillary Justice_ by Ann Leckie.

_Autobiography of Yogi_ by Paramahansa Yogananda. Caveat: this book was written for a Christian audience in the 1950s; _Fourth Uncle in the Mountain_ provided helpful normalization.

_The Big Sleep_ by Raymond Chandler.

_Brave New World_ by Aldous Huxley.

_The Botany of Desire_ by Michael Pollan.

_Dune_ by Frank Herbert.

_Fahrenheit 451_ by Ray Bradbury.

_Fourth Uncle in the Mountain_, by Marjorie Pivar and Quang Van Nguyen.

All three _Germline_ books by T.C. McCarthy.

_A Heaven in the Eye_ by Clyde Rice.

_Housewife's Handbook on Selective Promiscuity_ by Rey Anthony and Toni Savant.

_How to Change Your Mind_ by Michael Pollan.

_The Invincible_ by Stanislaw Lem.

_Prey_ by Michael Crichton.

_Starship Troopers_ by Robert Heinlein.

The _Ramayana_ by Tulsidas.

_Tibet's Great Yogi Milarepa_ by W.Y. Evans-Wentz.

_The Urban Homestead_ by Kelly Coyne and Erik Knutzen. Pairs well with _Wild Fermentation_.

_Why We Make Things and Why It Matters_ by Peter Korn.

_Wild Fermentation_ by Sandor Katz.
