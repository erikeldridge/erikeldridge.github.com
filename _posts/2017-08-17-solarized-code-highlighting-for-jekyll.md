## Problem

I'd like to improve readability of the code on this blog by highlighting syntax, [solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) ideally.

## Solution

Jekyll makes [syntax highlighting](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/#code-snippet-highlighting) easy, and the following gist makes solarization easy too:

{% gist nicolashery/5765395 solarized-light.css %}
